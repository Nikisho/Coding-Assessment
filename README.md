Got this test for a Graduate Software Engineer role in London. 

General Programming

1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as a sequence of integers starting with 1 and 1, where each
subsequent value is the sum of the preceding two. I.e.
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) where n >= 2
Write a program in a language of your choice to calculate the sum of the first 100 even-valued
Fibonacci numbers
2. Write a function in a language of your choice which, when passed two sorted arrays of integers
returns an array of any numbers which appear in both. No value should appear in the returned
array more than once.
3. Write a function in a language of your choice which, when passed a positive integer returns
true if the decimal representation of that integer contains no odd digits and otherwise returns
false.

Python Programming

1. Define a generator which generates the positive integers up to and including a supplied value
which are divisible by another supplied positive integer and use it to calculate the sum of all
positive integers less than 102030 which are divisible by 3
2. Write a function which is passed an integer, n, and returns a list of n lists such that:
f(0) returns []
f(1) returns [[1]]
f(2) returns [[1], [1,2]]
f(3) returns [[1], [1,2], [1,2,3]]
etc.

Java Programming Test

1. Implement (from scratch, without using Java library components) a doubly linked list (of
integers) class which allows new integers to be added to either end of the list, any referenced
node to be removed, and the first and last integers to be read quickly.
2. Write a Java function which, when passed a string containing a mixture of bracket characters -
i.e. ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘(‘ and ‘)’, returns true if the brackets in the string are correctly balanced, and
false otherwise. E.g. when called with “{[(())]()}” it should return true, but “{[(()])()}” should
return false. Non-bracket characters in the string should be ignored.
